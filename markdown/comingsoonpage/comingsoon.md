  **Project #OPENEDUCATION ([https://github.com/​activelearningstudio](https://github.com/activelearningstudio))** Project #OPENEDUCATION is an ambitious joint effort between Red Hat and the non-profit education technology company, Curriki. \

  \

  The project’s vision is: ***To reimagine education at every level and point in life, and do it through sharing, open technologies, and open content.***


  > \

  > “A modern education should build and accredit basic skills – reading, writing and math – as well as skills in problem-solving, creativity, critical thinking that young people need for work, to start a business and to engage productively in their communities.”

  >

  Project #OPENEDUCATION will leave a large and indelible mark in solving these problems by making the tools used to create, deliver, and distribute high-quality, effective, and measurable learning experiences free, open and easy to access. Make a different. Join the #OPENEDUCATION movement!
