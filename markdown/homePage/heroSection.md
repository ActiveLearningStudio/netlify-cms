  “The principle goal of education in the schools should be creating men and
  women who are capable of doing new things, not simply repeating what other
  generations have done; men and women who are creative, inventive and
  discoverers, who can be critical and verify, and not accept, everything they
  are offered.”

  ― Jean Piaget
